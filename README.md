ByBike is a application which solves, potentially time consuming and dangerous routing problems such as diversion into disfavored areas which are inaccessible,  heavily trafficked or require excessive energy to overcome such as an uphill road. The aim is to improve cyclistâ€™s routes to their destination so the user can have more enjoyable journeys and keep them safe by bringing to attention any obstructions or potential problems on their route. ByBike plans to grant navigation advice primarily based on community feedback, allowing the user to self-verify which route they want to take.

Based from previous submissions, we intended to write this program in HTML,CSS, JavaScript and PHP. We then opted to using A mean stack due to people not being well versed in javascript. Initially, we where going to use minimal javascript and work mainly on html,css and php. However, when it came to implement and write the code for the prototype, we found it would be a lot more effecient and appropriate to include AngularJS, especially based on the fact that it helps to communicate backend and frontend.
